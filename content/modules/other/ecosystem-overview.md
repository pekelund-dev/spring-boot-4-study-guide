## Common building blocks

- **Spring Boot 4**: application framework and auto-configuration.
- **Spring Framework 7**: core DI, web, data access foundations.
- **Spring Security 7**: authentication and authorization.
- **Spring AI**: model integration and RAG pipelines.

## Supporting projects

- **Spring Data**: persistence abstractions for relational and NoSQL stores.
- **Spring Batch**: scheduled batch workflows.
- **Spring Cloud**: distributed system patterns.

### Best practices

> **Best Practice:** Start with Boot + Web + Data before layering in cloud or AI dependencies.

> **Best Practice:** Keep Spring projects aligned to compatible release trains.
